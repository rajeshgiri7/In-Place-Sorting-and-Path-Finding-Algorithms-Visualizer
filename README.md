# AlgoVisualizer
AlgoVisualizer is an algorithm visualization tool created for better understanding and inner workings of the algorithm. 
Myself along with many experts belive that learning comes better with visualization. So this program is created for better graspment of the ways of Algorithms.

Algorithm visualizer is a tool created by using python equipped with Graphs and interactive GUI so one can be fully engaged with the program.

AlgoVisualizer features Visualization of Sorting and Pathfinding Algorithms. The sorting Algorithm used currently are inplaced Sorting Algorithms featuring 
BUBBLE, SELECTION, INSERTION & QUICK Sorts. 

Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool which finds path from a node to another. It features BFS, DFS, A* and Djkstra Algorithm.
It also has a prebuit maze u can generate to make your life easier.
